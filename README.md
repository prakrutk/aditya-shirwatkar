### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior undergraduate student in Mechanical Engineering at [Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), Nagpur](http://vnit.ac.in/), who is an aspiring robotics researcher and wishes to make the world a better place through the advancements in robotics and AI :innocent:
<br>
**More About Me**:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [**Trajectory Optimization (focused on Bipedal Systems)**](https://github.com/IvLabs/biped_trajectory_optimization) and implementing few **Optimal Control algorithms** on Underactuated Systems as well as researching on **Reconfigurable Robot** locomotion.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking forward to researching various ways to integrate **Optimal Controls** with new advancements in **Reinforcement Learning** and applying them on **Reconfigurable systems**.
- ðŸ’¬ I am happy to share my experiences in robotics and would like to hear about yours too.
